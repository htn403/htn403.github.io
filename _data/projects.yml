  descriptions:
    - Errors in Web tables are difficult to detect and correct because of its unknownness, heterogeneity and rarity.
    - In this research, we proactively leverage human feedback using a neural-symbolic framework to increase the error detection performance. 
    - The framework uses Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) to infer the active learning examples and Deep Neural Networks to classify errors based on labeled examples.

  descriptions:
    - Learning transformations to convert data between different formats is challenging since it normally requires extensive user effort to find and label examples in each format.
    - In this research, we proposed an unsupervised approach to transform data by leveraging hierarchical clustering to group string values into multiple format-like clusters and infer the transformations between clusters using semantic labeling techniques without any user labeling. (ISWC 2016 paper).

  descriptions:
    - The problem of source modeling is to automatically build semantic descriptions of data for publishing structured sources to knowledge graphs. 
    - Semantic labeling is an important step in source modeling where attributes in data sources are mapped with the corresponding properties in ontologies.
    - We use generalized pairwise similarity measures to generate features and binary classification to predict the properties of each attribute.
